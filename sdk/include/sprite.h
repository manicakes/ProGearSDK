 * @brief DEPRECATED - Low-level sprite utilities.
 *
 * This header is deprecated. Sprite hardware access is now internal
 * to the SDK and handled by the hw/ layer.
 *
 * Game code should use the high-level APIs instead:
 * - Actor system: actor.h
 * - Backdrop system: backdrop.h
 * - Terrain system: terrain.h
 * - UI system: ui.h

/* This header is intentionally empty.
 * It exists only for backward compatibility with code that includes it.
 * All sprite hardware access is now abstracted in hw/sprite.h (internal). */
